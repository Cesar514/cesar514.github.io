## **About**
<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown="1">
**Age:** 23 <br>
**Gender:** Male <br>
**Languages:** English, Spanish, French. <br>
**Likes:** Rain. Music. <br>
**Hashtags:** #LoveFood #AI <br>
<br>
I like learning and applying technology to solve problems in different areas.
My main objective is to solve whatever problem comes next that will help make the world
a better place. <br>
At school I worked in multiple team projects related to the programming of robotic systems,
automation, manufacturing, design, software and computer vision systems.
If I need to get something done and I don’t know how to do it,
I learn how to do it and get it done.<br>
Today I'm specially interested in the use of VR and AR for a better development of society
and a better education system. I'm also interested in the brain, and dreams, and
maybe I'll continue investigating things related to that. <br>
I like learning a lot, I tend to take courses all around the internet about
things I would like to learn how to do.

## **Experience**

### **Career Experiences**

**Trainee Robotics Engineer** <br>
*Laboratory of Automation and Manufacturing Anáhuac México* ***2020***
* Worked on a team of 4 in the development of a methodology for the implementation of ROS with existing lab equipment, allowing the development of future projects with the framework.
* Performed different simulations of Robots using CIROS Studio, Gazebo, CoppeliaSim, MoveIt and MATLAB, connecting with the ROS frameworks, validating its functionality.
* Assisted in the development of custom applications for vision systems using Python. <br>

**Technology and Innovation Engineer** <br>
*Centro de Alta Dirección en Ingeniería y Tecnología Anáhuac México* ***2019 → 2020***
* Worked with dentists in the research of possible applications for the 3D printing of lower jaws and teeth using DICOM files, testing the prints in different materials and simulating them for possible prothesis designs.
* Custom automation and modification of 3D printing hardware to work with inhouse materials, saving the costs of acquiring new equipment.
* Worked on a team in the documentation of the problem analysis and the presented solutions for the possibility of replicating and improving each solution.
* Prototyping and testing of body equipment to improve and adapt the functionality of existing HMI technology.
* Handled newly acquired equipment and components on a small team tasked with finding possible applications for them using quick prototyping techniques. The equipment included commercially available hardware and inhouse technology. <br>

**Mechatronics Student Club Captain** <br>
*Laboratory of Automation and Manufacturing Anáhuac México* ***2018→2020***
* Led a team of 6 and successfully worked on different time-based projects saving up to 15% of the time allocated for the projects, managing to reduce some final products cost by a 5 to 10%.
* Identified multiple acceptable resolutions to engineering problems and worked on selecting the most efficient solution.
* Developed CAD files for simple robotic models, electronical schematics for simulations, worked on the programming of embedded systems and successfully prototyped multiple projects to verify their viability. <br>
