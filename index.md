## **Status Update**
Working on a project with self generating art. ***03/11/2022***

## **About Me**
<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown="1">
**Age:** 24 <br>
**Gender:** Male <br>
**Languages:** English, Spanish, French. <br>
**Likes:** Rain. Music. AI. <br>
<br>
I am me. I’ve been working on some neural networks, robotics, software engineering, CNC manufacturing and computer vision for the last months. Learning new things and applying those with engineering and technology to solve problems found in different areas is what I enjoy the most. I want to work on solving problems which solution could make the world a better place for humanity. <br>
I’ve worked with electronics since I was a child. Been programming since elementary school. Worked in multiple team projects related to the programming and construction of robotic systems, projects related to industrial automation, manufacturing, pieces design, software development and computer vision.
Whenever I need to get something done and I don’t know how to do it I learn how to do it and get it done. <br>
I’m especially interested in areas related to intelligent systems, cognitive systems, robotics, assistive technologies, adaptive VR, AR and cyber-physical systems. I’m also interested in the brain, emotions and simulated environments. <br>
Dreams are interesting as well, knowing more about the way they work is also one of my priorities <br>
