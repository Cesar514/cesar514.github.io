## Objective

<div align="justify" markdown="1">
- Build a Lego cart in Creo Parametric.
- Achieve a good assembly with the pieces so they do not have interferences between them.
- Show that the 3D model has the correct measurements compared to the real model.
</div>

## Problem Statement

<div align="justify" markdown="1">
This mechanical model that was taken to a 3D model is a car made by the Lego company. Its main function is to be a toy for children. This car can move when it is assembled correctly and has all the necessary parts. It is convenient to take it to 3D to be able to see the operation that each piece exerts within this toy. It is considered that by doing this project it will be possible to understand the importance of each piece, no matter how small and insignificant it may seem.
