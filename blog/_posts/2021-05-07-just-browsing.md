Just sharing for fun some things I like

<div align="justify" markdown="1">
I like watching YouTube videos and the songs from musicals are something I really like.

This is a song from *Death Note: The Musical*. It is part of the 2015 English Concept Album.
I like this song, and sometimes it makes me think in angels, demons, and things that are out there
watching us from above. And I feel curious about their intentions.

This is the original Japanese version, and it also sounds great, I also loved the performance from the actors
in the video.
